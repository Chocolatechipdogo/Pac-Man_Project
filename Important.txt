maze information
numpy.loadtxt creates a 2d array will be use to loop through the file 
numpy array.shape[0] grabs the rows of the 2-d array
numpy array.shape[1] grabs the cols of the 2-d array
+ means that a node is in that position of the maze (of verticies in a graph)
. means the path to the next node (or edges in a graph)
x means that their is empty space no node or edge)

Node class information
instead of storing the nodes in a list it is stored in a dictionary 
in the nodes dictionary the key is the (x, y) point and value is the node itself
dictionary used to create the graph to know which nodes are connected to each other
