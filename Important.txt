maze information
numpy.loadtxt creates a 2d array will be use to loop through the file 
numpy array.shape[0] grabs the rows of the 2-d array
numpy array.shape[1] grabs the cols of the 2-d array
a '+' or 'P',or 'n', means to place a node in that position (verticies of the graph)
a '.', '-', '|', 'p', place a path in that position (edges of the graph)
X means an empyt space do not place anything on the map 

Node class information
instead of storing the nodes in a list it is stored in a dictionary 
in the nodes dictionary the key is the (x, y) point and value is the node itself
dictionary used to create the graph to know which nodes are connected to each other 

character class 
since both pacman and the ghosts move in a simliar way a character class is best for 
both pacman and the ghosts should inherit from 
character class will control the movement around the nodes/maze created
